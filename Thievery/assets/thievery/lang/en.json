    "thievery:thievery-text": "<strong>Thievery</strong><br><i>Locked doors and chests are no longer simple obstacles—they’re puzzles waiting to be solved.</i><br><br>The <strong>Lockpicking</strong> challenges your dexterity and patience. Use a <a href=\"handbook://item-thievery:lockpick-steel\">Lockpick</a> in your main hand and a <a href=\"handbook://item-thievery:tensionwrench-iron\">Tension Wrench</a> in your off-hand to attempt to crack locks. Success requires careful timing, precision, and strategy.<br><br><strong>Controls:</strong> Use <hk>walkleft</hk> and <hk>walkright</hk> to move between pins. Hold <hk>leftmouse</hk> to press a pin, and release to attempt to set it. A <em>click</em> sound signals either a hotspot (correct placement) or a false set. Be attentive!<br><br><strong>Binding Pins:</strong> Some pins are “binding.” These cannot be set until non-binding pins are dealt with. If you try, you’ll receive a warning, and the pin will reset. Binding order changes dynamically as you progress.<br><br><strong>False Sets:</strong> Higher-difficulty locks include false set positions. These mimic correct placement but will spring back later, often unsetting other pins. The harder the lock, the more false sets to watch for.<br><br><strong>Unsetting:</strong> Mistakes or hitting false sets can randomly unset one of your already-placed pins. Stay focused and be prepared to reattempt pins as you progress.<br><br><strong>Damage & Durability:</strong> Forcing pins incorrectly wears down your tools. Lockpicks take the brunt of mistakes, while tension wrenches degrade steadily over time as you apply pressure. Stock up before tackling difficult locks.<br><br><strong>Difficulty Scaling:</strong> Easy locks may only have 3 pins, while brutal locks include up to 7 pins with many false sets. Harder locks also increase tool damage, false set frequency, and binding complexity. <br><br><em>Tip:</em> Beginners are encouraged to practice on <a href=\"handbook://item-padlock-copper\">Copper Padlocks</a>. They are the easiest to open and provide the perfect way to learn the rhythm of lock picking and to recognize what a true set click sounds like.<br><br><strong>Success:</strong> Once every pin is correctly set, the lock opens automatically. Timing, recognition of audio cues, and managing risk are the keys to success.<br><br><strong>Failure:</strong> If your lockpick or wrench breaks mid-attempt, the lock resets and you’ll need fresh tools to try again.",
